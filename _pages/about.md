Giulia is a PhD student in Computer Science at UC Berkeley and a graduate research assistant at the Computational Research Division of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory advised by [Aydın Buluç](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~aydin/) and [Kathy Yelick](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yelick/). Giulia is a [2020 SIGHPC Computational & Data Science Fellow](https://www.sighpc.org/for-your-career/fellowships/2020-fellowship-winners?fbclid=IwAR2N8swtCYgNH3phRmrFtASSC42b4oN5joG1l5XHFSdnkMY6U4HvZt3olLE) and a member of the [PASSION Lab](https://passion.lbl.gov/), the [BeBOp Group](https://bebop.cs.berkeley.edu/), and the [Performance and Algorithms Research (PAR) Group](https://crd.lbl.gov/departments/computer-science/par/members/students/giulia-guidi/). She received her M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering from [Politecnico di Milano](http://polimi.it/en). Giulia's research focuses on developing a novel algorithm for de novo assembly of genomes in distributed memory using long read sequencing data as part of the [ExaBiome](https://sites.google.com/lbl.gov/exabiome) project and on how to make cloud computing more accessible for high performance scientific computing. Giulia is interested in the intersection of High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Computational Biology as enabling technologies for faster, high-quality bioinformatics and biomedical research.
